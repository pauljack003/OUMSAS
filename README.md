HI! This repo is basically anything that *isn't* private. I'm not sharing anything related to exams, coursework, or even studies or my own personal notes here. 

Instead, this repo is used for two, maybe three, purposes:

1 - As a home for any work submitted, where submission required the use of git, or where it made the most sense to post the assignment to git for submission.
2 - As a workspace where data, packages and related information is cloned and updated for ongoing research and/or assignments.
3 - Possibly as a place to keep some random work associated with my studies, but not explicitly an assignment or homework. Think of it as my scratchpad.

All of what will be here is going to be R code, and various markdown files that fits into one of the three above purposes.
