Repository for all things associated with my pursuit of the MS Applied Stats degree at OU.

I won't be storing everything here, of course, as this is a public repository. But this is a good spot to store work that either needs to be submitted or peer reviewed, or for other work I might do associated with my degree that can be publicly available.
