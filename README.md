This repo is basically anything that *isn't* private. I'm not sharing anythign related to exams, or even studies or my own notes here. 

Instead, this repo is used for two, maybe three, purposes:

1 - As a home for any work submitted, where submission required the use of git, or where it made most sense to post the assignment to git for submission.
2 - As a workspace where data and related information is cloned and updated for ongoing research and/or assignments.
3 - Possibly as a place to keep some random work associated with my studies, but not explicitly an assignment or homework. Think of it as my scratchpad.

Most of what will be here is going to be R code, and various markdown files.
